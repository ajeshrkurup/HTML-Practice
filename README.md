# HTML-Practice
Learning HTML by coding it. As we all know to master a skill we need to use it. Here I'm going to practice HTML by coding with all tags including new HTML5 tags. I hope by the end of day , I will call myself a master of HTML. 

Why I created a github repository just  for practicing ? 
   Answer is simple, so that I can master GitHub and Terminal usage. 
   ie 3 in 1 :) --> HTML , GitHub and Terminal
